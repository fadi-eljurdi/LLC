                            <h1>Technology Law</h1>
                            <p>Over the past decade the need for quality Technology Legal services in the MENAT region has surged. We noticed the growing need for quality legal services in this sector. We also noticed a disconnect between legal advising and Technology project management requirements. Absent speed, agility and proper legal project planning, Legal services not mirroring a technology project planning and execution frameworks and methodologies can create bottle necks for Technology projects and make its delivery and adherence to Technology projects timeline mere luck. In providing legal services to the Technology sector, JURDI keeps the pace of our clientâ€™s Technology projects and anticipates legal bottle necks and communicate that and proposed solutions, so that legal work does not undermine Technology project progress. We represent individuals and entities whose main line of business is in the Tech & Telco industry. We are here to help you protect your interests and proprietary rights. We primary service small-to-medium sized technology companies that are engaged in or with businesses in the local market and across the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey (MENAT) region through a network of trusted law professionals. Our firm also provides consultancy to creative groups in the Technology Industry. We take pride in being allies of all creatives but mostly in supporting those who need our guidance and consulting services most. For that, we are committed to be there first for this segment of the creative community. Even though our focus is media and technology, we understand that our clients may need a helping hand in other areas of the law, for that we extend or assistance to our clients to other areas of practice such as employment, corporate, data protection, privacy law, mediating, litigation and arbitration, as well as advising on and other law matters that are of relevance to their services or line of business and that may arise in connection to our clients' technology affairs.<br><br><br></p>
