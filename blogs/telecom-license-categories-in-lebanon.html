                            <h1>Telecom License Categories in Lebanon</h1>
                            <p>Administered by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA), the licensing mechanism is divided into three distinct categories: Restricted Licenses, Individual Licenses, and Class Licenses. Each category has its unique licensing procedure and requirements as defined under the Licensing Regulation, focusing on the nature of services, facilities operation, and licensing norms.<br><br>Restricted Licenses form the first category, characterized by a limitation in the number of licenses made available. This license type is meant for legal entities duly registered in Lebanon and meeting specific qualifications earmarked for such licenses. The application procedure involves responding to a Request for Applications (RFA) drafted and publicized by the TRA. A key feature of this license type is the necessity of a competitive process for acquiring the license, requiring formal approval from the TRA. In certain cases, the process also involves a proposal from the minister of telecommunication and a decree from the Council of Ministers. An intrinsic attribute of this license category is the inclusion of the right to construct facilities, which might come along with roll-out and coverage obligations.<br><br>The second category, Individual Licenses, contrasts with the restricted licenses as they are not limited in number. Entities eligible for this license type are legal entities registered in Lebanon that fulfill minimum non-competitive eligibility criteria. Unlike Restricted Licenses, the application process does not necessitate a specific RFA, and there is no requirement for a competitive process. The TRA's approval is mandatory, but the license is deemed issued if the application is not denied within 30 days from submission. Contrary to the Restricted Licenses, this category does not automatically encompass the right to build facilities and doesn't include any roll-out and coverage obligations.<br><br>The final category, Class Licenses, is designed for Lebanese residents or legal entities registered in Lebanon. This category encompasses a range of licenses, including Internet Service Providers (ISP), Value Added Services, Resale of services, Wireless zone Internet access, Satellite telephony user, among others. Like Individual Licenses, the Class Licenses do not automatically grant the right to build facilities and exclude any roll-out and coverage obligations.<br><br>Undertanding the different types of telecom licenses in Lebanon's is the first step for companies aspiring to establish their presence in the industry. Tech companies are advised to seek specialized legal assistance to navigate the complex regulatory framework of Lebanon's telecommunication regulatory landscape.Â <br><br><br></p>
