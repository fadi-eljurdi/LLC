                            <h1>Media & Film Production Law</h1>
                            <p>We represent everyone working in the media sector including but not limited to print and digital media publishers, artists, advertising agencies, production houses, studios, and broadcasters. Our services extend to foreign entities planning to have business engagements or to enter the MENAT region and to International and regional businesses that have an existing business engagement in the MENAT region. This includes advising on all regulatory and legal frameworks of the region and of any specific sub-region, country, or state, covering media-related issues, general trading or otherwise. We provide legal services in all media-related fields from conventional media to metaverse. We represent our clients, and negotiate on their behalf complex deals that require the kind of services that we provide and the advanced skills that our people possess. We save our clients precious time and money represented in the opportunities that they may miss or lose if they decided to negotiate their deal directly or if they decided to engage non-media specialists. We advise and represent clients in relation to the legal affairs of content development, production, and distribution across the MENAT region (Middle East, North Africa & Turkey) through a network of independent and trusted legal advisors, saving clients the time and effort needed to identify and establish a trusting relationship with firms in each country of the region. Our firm has experiential knowledge in leading and managing media-related joint ventures and in media-related tax incentives, financing and rebate schemes. Whatever a media organisation (advertising agencies and media buyers included) or a talent’s question is, we are happy, qualified, and ready to answer it. We develop long-term relationships with our clients and provide them with a one-stop-shop headache-free kind of service. We also make sure that the consultants handling your case elsewhere are being instructed, briefly and efficiently and are attending to your matters in the best and most viable manner. We also manage all affairs of our media clients, whether related to commercial agency law, corporate commercial law, rebate-related media regulation, tax incentives, banking, and financing of production projects as well media regulatory affairs. We help our clients with the representation before any media specialised tribunals and media regulatory bodies.<br><br><br><br></p>
